The Hungarian algorithm is used for solving the assignment problem!

The Hungarian Method: The following algorithm applies the above
theorem to a given n Ã— n cost matrix to find an optimal assignment.

Step 1. Subtract the smallest entry in each row from all the entries of its
row.

Step 2. Subtract the smallest entry in each column from all the entries
of its column.

Step 3. Draw lines through appropriate rows and columns so that all the
zero entries of the cost matrix are covered and the minimum number of
such lines is used.

Step 4. Test for Optimality: (i) If the minimum number of covering lines
is n, an optimal assignment of zeros is possible and we are finished. (ii) If
the minimum number of covering lines is less than n, an optimal
assignment of zeros is not yet possible. In that case, proceed to Step 5.

Step 5. Determine the smallest entry not covered by any line. Subtract this
entry from every unmarked element and add it to every element covered by two lines.
