Huffman code is a type of optimal prefix code.
For more information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding

Constructor of this class takes a name of file as an argument. In the file, each line must be of format: 
letter frequencyOfTheLetter
(See an example file 'huffman1.txt')
Of course, sum of all letter frequencies must be one.

The algorithm then maps the letters to the {0,1} codewords.
